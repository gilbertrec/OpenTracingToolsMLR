Application performance management (APM) providers like New Relic and AppDynamics are in a market adjacent to Seerene. While they focus on the intersection of hardware and software, Seerene looks at the intersection of software and people. These management systems are both critical to building a world-class company.

Seerene will help you speed up the pace of product innovation and accelerate time to market by giving you a clear view across codebases and development capacity, both internal and outsourced. It creates visual maps so you can see the number of FTEs invested into a project, understand its code quality, and gain clarity on the risks and key person dependencies.

With both a APM and code+people management, you’ll be able to achieve true operational excellence and run faster than the competition.
