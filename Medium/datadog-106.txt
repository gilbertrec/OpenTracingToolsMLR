For past couple of weeks we observed an extraordinary increase in traffic on our website (graana.com). We are using aws for our production environment but it was difficult to keep an eye on the metrics using htop or other command line tool we love. So we decided to move to datadog which gave us excellent insights of our whole infrastructure.
We found many difficulties in integrating elasticbeanstalk with datadog as other events can be handled with lambda and for EC2 instances we need to have datadog agent to be installed on each of the machine, but elasticbeanstalk behaviour is quite different, it replaces whole instance group after the deployment so we had to figure out a way to automate this with each deployment.
After putting efforts we found a way to achieve this.
In root of .ebextensions, create a file named “99datadog.config”
As we want realtime insights of each process too, create another file named: “datadog-process.config”
Repos to install data dog agent from. named: .ebextensions/datadog/datadog.repo
finally the start hook: “.ebextensions/datadog/hooks/99start_datadog.sh”
and stop hook, “.ebextensions/datadog/hooks/99stop_datadog.sh”
