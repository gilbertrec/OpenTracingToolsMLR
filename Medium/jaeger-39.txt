OpenTracing provides annotation driven based such as @Traced. The annotation is very simple concept which makes very easy to use and understand. However, there are some limitations on it.
Secondly, Spring Sleuth have couple of annotations which have much flexible way of defining the tracing span according to your needs such as@NewSpan, @SpanTag, etc… but Spring Sleuth does not support OpenTracing yet.
As a result, I am creating custom annotations library for OpenTracing purposed — OpenTracing Java Annotation. The library is very small and does not depends on Spring but can be integrated to Spring. There are couple of usages you can make use of the annotations:
Creating a new span
@NewSpan
public void calculateTax(TaxModel model) {
    ...
}
Override Default Span’s OperationName
@NewSpan(operationName=”calculateGST”)
public void calculateTax(TaxModel model) {
    ...
}
Include Tag on Span
@NewSpan
public void calculateTax(TaxModel model, @SpanTag("tag-name") String tagValue) { 
    ...
}
Dynamic Tag on Span
@NewSpan(tagMapper = @SpanTagMapper(resolver = TaxModelTagMapper.class))
public void calculateTax(TaxModel model) {
  ...
}
public class TaxModelTagMapper implements TagMapper<TaxModel> {
  public Map<String, Object> tag(TaxModel model) throws Exception {
    ...
  }
} 
Integrating to SpringBoot
Step 1: Register the Aspect class as spring bean:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">
<bean class="io.opentracing.contrib.annotation.handler.NewSpanHandler" />
</beans>
Step 2: Include SpringBoot AOP dependencies
compile 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop'
