In my first post Rootless Datadog Containers 6.x, I explain how we worked around our limitations in running containers in OpenShift as non-root users for 6.x. We have made some additional changes that take us in a better direction and remove the dependency on supervisord.
Below is an example datadog.yml having some place holder/replacement variables using %xyz%.

When we start Datadog, we use the following commands from our entrypoint script passing along some params to optionally enable or disable APM and Process monitoring

This has proven to be a much better solution than using supervisord. One caveat is that when running the datadog-agent process locally on the Mac, the process agent and trace agent will start automatically. This is also true when using some other operating systems, however due to our installation and our inability to register processes and dependent processes with something like sysctrl, we need to start these separately. Here is the link to the official Datadog CentOS docs.
