Watch your application’s performance.
I have been working with elastic stack for last couple of years and have used most of the beats filebeat, monitoringbeat, and packetbeat for various system and platform modules like kafka, redis, mongodb,filesystem,and host resources CPU/Memory monitoring. I found setting up ELK is comparatively easier than other monitoring tools for a quick and clear visualisation of business and technical KPIs.
Recently looked into APM (Application Performance Monitoring) from the elastic stack and tried to integrate it with NodeJS based application.It indeed gives really nice stats about application performance quickly.I found it quite handy to quickly monitor my APIs performance and find application bottleneck if any.
What can be monitored with APM ?
CPU usage
Memory usage
Throughput (TPS/RPS) and average response time.
Transaction span breakup (e.g. time spend on DB operation , external http calls , app internal processing etc..)
Can create custom span if doesn’t exist in default list.
Micro services based interaction and flow.
Setup APM server
Setting up APM server is fairly easy. Install below components :
Elastic search
Kibana
APM server
I have used docker compose to setup the whole stack.

APM Integration
APM comes with predefined set of modules that are monitored just by integrating APM sdk with in your app.
NodeJS based integration
# install apm node module
    npm install elastic-apm-node
# Add below code to your startup script 
     // Add this to the VERY top of the first file loaded in your    
     appconst apm = require('elastic-apm-node').start({    
        // Override service name from package.json    
        // Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, -, _, and space       
      serviceName: 'cart-manager', })
That’s it your application is ready to be monitored.
