* Datadog introduction:-
In this part, we will see the whole data dog dashboard introduction. I will explain all the major key sections.
A. Events:-
The Event Stream is based on the same conventions as a blog:
Every event in the stream can be commented on.
Great for distributed teams and maintaining the focus of an investigation.
You can filter by: user, source, tag, host, status, priority, incident
On the left-hand side, you can see a list of all data sources integrated.

B. Dashboards:- There are 2 types of the dashboard you can create using Datadog
New Timeboard â€” For troubleshooting and correlation
Time-synchronized metrics and event graph Automatic layout. Timeboards allows you to troubleshoot issues by pinpointing to the metrics and services at the same time.

Datadog time board
2. New Screenboard â€” For status board and sharing data.
Mix widget and timeframes Custom drag-and-drop layout. Screenboards are ideal for checking the overall health and status of the services and entire architecture.

The Infrastructure list page shows all hosts monitored by your Datadog application.

you can see the tags applied to each machine; as theyâ€™re assigned to perform certain roles, tagging allows you to indicate machines have a certain purpose.
D. Monitors:-
Applies to any metric you want, revenue: data center temperature.
Multi alerts (by device, host, etc.)
Set alert notification message
E. APM(Tracing):-
Datadog APM provides you with deep insight into your applicationâ€™s performance-from automatically generated dashboards monitoring key metrics

* How to integrate:-
More than 200 built-in integrations. you can integrate it into your project here is an interactive video to get started.
* Implement it with REST service
