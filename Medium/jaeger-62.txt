The OpenTracing and Jaeger projects are glad to participate in the next Outreachy internship program, under the “CNCF Tracing” umbrella.
We are really excited to announce that an intern has been selected! Prakriti Bansal (@PikkiBot) will be helping us improve the documentation for both projects.
We are grateful to all the contributions we received from all applicants: it’s been tough to select only one among so many qualified candidates!
Welcome to the team, Prakriti!
