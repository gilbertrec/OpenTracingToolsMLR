About Tanzu Portfolio
VMWare assembled Tanzu Portfolio of products to help clients in their cloud native journey. When I started reading about Tanzu, the very first confusion i had to understand Tanzu Kubernetes Grid deployment models and after reviewing multiple blog posts, I have been able to understand. Shortly, I will be explaining but before that, lets understand the various Tanzu products.

Tanzu Products
First, Lets understand the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG) Concept and it’s architecture:
“VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid provides Enterprise organizations with a consistent, upstream compatible, regional Kubernetes substrate across SDDC, Public Cloud, and Edge environments that is ready for end-user workloads and ecosystem integrations. TKG builds on trusted upstream and community projects and delivers an engineered and supported Kubernetes platform for end users and partners.”

TKG Architecture & Components
VMware offers TKG in two flavours 1. TKG 2. TKG plus. While TKG and TKG plus are intended to achieve same purpose but the differences mainly is that TKG plus provide production ready Kubernetes cluster along with monitoring, logging, registry and security options.
To know the difference between TKG and TKG plus, read the below KB article from VMware:

That’s all in this post, In the next post, I will discuss about remaining Tanzu products & their deployment model.
