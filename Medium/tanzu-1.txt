New Kubernetes versions:
1.20.5
1.19.9
1.18.17
Workload clusters no longer use the Tanzu Mission Control Extension Manager.
OIDC authentication no longer uses dex .
Running tanzu cluster create --dry-run generates a workload cluster template from a configuration file without requiring a management cluster.
Bill of Materials (BoM) handling supports custom registry sources for individual images, overriding default registry.
Users can upgrade add-ons independently of upgrading Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.
(vSphere) Supports routable, no-NAT IP addresses for workload cluster pods, enabling traceability and auditing.
(vSphere v6.7) Installer interface includes access and configuration options for NSX-T Advanced Load Balancer.
(vSphere) Supports deploying multiple MachineDeployment and KubeadmControlPlane objects without changing overlay file.
(Azure) New cluster configuration variables:
AZURE_CUSTOM_TAGS applies Azure tags to cluster resources.
AZURE_ENABLE_PRIVATE_CLUSTER and AZURE_FRONTEND_PRIVATE_IP run workload clusters as private clusters with internal load balancers.
AZURE_ENABLE_NODE_DATA_DISK optionally provisions a data disk for worker nodes.
AZURE_CONTROL_PLANE_ and AZURE_NODE_ variables for DATA_DISK_SIZE_GIB and OS_DISK_SIZE_GIB configure data and OS disk sizes for control plane and worker nodes.
AZURE_CONTROL_PLANE_OS_DISK_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_TYPE and AZURE_NODE_OS_DISK_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_TYPE specify storage account for control plane and worker node disks.
(Azure) Future-compatibility cluster configuration variable AZURE_ENABLE_ACCELERATED_NETWORKING enables Azure accelerated networking when TKRs support it. (Currently Azure TKRs do not support Azure accelerated networking.
