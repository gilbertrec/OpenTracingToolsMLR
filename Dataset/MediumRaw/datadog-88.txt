You can find terraform-aws-cloudwatch-to-syslog-server on GitHub, and in the Terraform Registry.
AWS CloudWatch is meant for durable and scalable log archiving. It is tightly integrated with ECS and, overall, the AWS ecosystem, which makes it an interesting choice for low-cost, long-term log archiving. However, the browsing experience is poor (AWS CloudWatch logs for Humans, Elasticsearch+Kibana).
Many third-party services with better browsing experience for logs offer a syslog server interface. That’s why we have open sourced a full solution, terraform-aws-cloudwatch-to-syslog-server, written as a Terraform module complete with an example and infrastructure tests (using the excellent Terratest), to pipe CloudWatch Logs to a syslog TCP server.

terraform-aws-cloudwatch-to-syslog-server subscribes to the AWS CloudWatch Logs put by various AWS services and streams them to third-party services via a TCP syslog server interface.
