Kloia partners with Instana for APM
After Kloians discovered Instana in their early stage during 2017, they played with it, piloted it, challenged it and after decided to be a partner with. This was purely a kloian-driven process.
Although we usually used to work with various APM alternatives, Instana has advantages especially if you have workload on Kubernetes and/or Microservices or if you have transition plans towards those… This is reflected in the tool by its features like:
Automated Discovery
Distributed Tracing
Automated Monitoring powered by Machine Learning
Kubernetes-native Monitoring
Besides,
It also works on-premises!
No application restart required! (For some certain type of software stack)

Instana is enriched with its sensors which can automatically detect and begin to collect metrics, including:
Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, OpenShift
Websphere, Weblogic, Varnish, Zookeeper
Spark, Solar, Hana, Redis, Neo4j, MongoDB, Cassandra, Kafta, ElasticSearch
PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle, MariaDB
AWS, GCP
Go, .NET, Java, Python, Haskell, Node.js, PHP
and many more…
We are constantly looking for new practices, approaches and tools for our Application Modernization and Microservices Transition projects. Instana fits well in that perspective with its Kubernetes-native support and Microservices-friendly features.

Here is a short introduction for Instana to get a fast initial feeling: https://www.kloia.com/instana
