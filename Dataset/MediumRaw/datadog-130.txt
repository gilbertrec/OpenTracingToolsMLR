Since NGINX is deployed most often on Datadog customers’ Docker containers, we thought it appropriate to use the chart above as a “proxy” for the cloud-native world. From this perspective, all the top technologies are open source, and most of them support data and messaging infrastructure. Interestingly, every single technology is now offered as a service (aaS). Despite the effort needed to keep distributions up to date, most won’t let you choose to pay for supported elasticsearch, Redis or MySQL. Moving forward, we know companies are looking forward to selling you services with verified Docker images that contain many of these offerings. Alternatively, most major cloud providers are beginning to offer them, just as they also provide supported Apache servers with web hosting.
