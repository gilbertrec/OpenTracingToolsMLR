Introduction
Datadog is a powerful platform for measuring ElasticSearch.
Recently our team met some issues when we upgrade our ElasticSearch.
With Datadog, we can easily monitor memory, query time and garbage collection.
Today I try to install that.
Unfortunately, it is only free for 14 days…..
Installing Datadog on Ubuntu
Use our easy one-step install.
DD_API_KEY=b96a25a6cf77c77f2ad1292480011aeb bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/cmd/agent/install_script.sh)"

Notice: if you met the problem, it would be proxy issue in apt-get
Datadog Configuration
The configuration files and folders for the Agent are located in:
/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
Configuration files for Integrations:
/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/
Configure the Agent (conf.yaml + datadog.yaml)
create conf.yaml
Firstly, we just clone the sample file (conf.yaml.example) to our target file (conf.yaml)
cd /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/elastic.d
sudo cp conf.yaml.example conf.yaml
Configure conf.yaml
in /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/elastic.d/conf.yam
we set the url, stats, tags and logs.

Configure datadog.yaml
/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
edit api_key, proxyand logs

Launch the datadog-agent
sudo service datadog-agent start
check the status
sudo datadog-agent status

NOTICE: each time you edit the files, please stop and start again
sudo service datadog-agent stop
sudo service datadog-agent start
sudo service datadog-agent restart
