New integration!
Datadog monitors every log produced by your application and aggregates that data into actionable metrics. You can then search, filter, and analyze your logs for troubleshooting. But like every log management tool, the problem is the amount: there is just too much to sift through.
And while metrics are a great way to visualize the issues across your stack, they are not enough the give you an accurate idea of every specific problem that each user experiences.
A lot of our user use Datadog as their log management tool. To make their lives easier, we have chosen it as our next integration. You can now troubleshoot your Datadog logs in Asayer:
Get the full context behind every issue
Replay any session that has backend errors. See a video of how the user experienced the issue, and how your stack behaved at that very moment (JS Console, Network Activity, Redux State, User Metadata, etc.).
Collaborate in real-time with your team to resolve them
MTTR in a live production environment is critical. None of us want to be dealing with too many users struggling to perform a workflow or simply leaving the app with a bad experience.
Asayer + Datadog makes it easy to collaborate in real-time. In fact, with our Slack and Jira integrations, you can share the sessions that have backend errors to your teammates for debugging, all from within the same application.
Follow our guide to integrate Datadog with Asayer.
