We announced our integration with Datadog back in November. With this integration, you can observe all your GraphQL queries and mutations made against your Hasura Cloud project’s API, and well as query success, failure, errors, and any exceptions that may occur.
ICYMI, we also recently announced our integration with New Relic.
In this post, we have a quick video guide on adding Datadog to your Hasura Cloud project in a few simple steps.
Why add Datadog to Hasura
Monitoring and tracking is a critical component to building robust tech-stacks, and having a native integration for Datadog that can consume your logs and metrics simplifies your APM infrastructure and logging infrastructure in general.
What data gets sent to Datadog
At the time of writing, we send logging events across http and ws with the following 5 metrics:
Average number of requests
Average request execution time
Success rate of requests
Active subscriptions
Number of websockets open.
You can read more in our docs page.
We will be adding additional metrics in the future. If you have a specific measurement need, let us know!
