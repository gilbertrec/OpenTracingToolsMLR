Startups rarely follow the playbook their founders draw-up and share with early investors.
When Olivier and Alexis first introduced Datadog to OV in 2013, they shared that enterprises were transitioning from legacy on-premise infrastructure to the cloud and how this was leading to fundamental changes in the diversity of underlying technologies, infrastructure scale in terms of number of computing units, frequency of software releases and number of people and roles involved in managing those changes.
Olivier and Alexis’ insights are even more relevant today than they were in 2013, and stellar execution has allowed them to realize their vision for Datadog of becoming the monitoring and analytics platform for the cloud age.
Congratulations on reaching a milestone many startups merely dream of: an IPO.

Thank you Olivier, Alexis, and Amit for putting the foundations in place for what Datadog has become and to the entire Datadog management team for leading the company to this milestone. Thank you to the thousands of current and former Datadog team members whose dedication to the mission, company, and customers has been unparalleled, and to our world class co-investors and board members Sunil, Shardul, Kirill, Dev, Matt, Michael and Julie.
As we watch you ring the opening bell of the NASDAQ today, we couldn’t feel more proud of you and what you’ve built. It’s been an honor to have been a part of your team for the last six years and share in what is a truly special journey.
Mackey Craven and the entire OV Team
