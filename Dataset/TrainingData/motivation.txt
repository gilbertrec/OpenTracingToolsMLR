SQS makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple the components of a cloud application.
AppDynamics Hosts 'Gearing Up For High Performance During Holiday Season' Webinar on Oct. 22, 2015When it comes to performance, web performance and mobile app are two of the most important aspects for both retailers and consumers.
Luckily, application monitoring has you covered.
AppDynamics Releases Microservices IQ Monitoring ToolOn Aug. 1, AppDynamics announced their summer release of their App iQ intelligent monitoring platform, which includes user engagement and business transaction monitoring, as well as system diagnostics.
As Matt Chotin put it, it's easier to use a less intelligent solution that tracks these individual pieces, but being able to corral that information together is ultimately more useful, so users can get a bigger picture of an application's health.
One does not have to be a developer or sysadmin to get a clear picture of application health.
The product is geared to be useful to stakeholders without technical backgrounds.
User experience and usage is obviously incredibly important.
If a user can't access the system, it can lead to a whole mess of problems for everyone involved.
Get end-to-end visibility into your Python application environment: First of all you need to have a way to understand your application topology and dependencies on other web services, applications, databases and underlying infrastructure.
You should be able to prioritize application performance issues based on the business impact of the transaction.
Monitor Applications at code-level depth: You need to have a strategy and tools in place to get in-depth application monitoring that allows you to drill down to the application code details visually.
You should be able to easily locate hot spots and slow methods within your application code drilling down from the end user experience.
You need to have a way to understand how database performance is impacting your overall application.
Correlate your Python application performance with underlying infrastructure: Finally, you need to understand infrastructure resource consumption in the context of application performance and end-user experience.
AppDynamics recently introduced the Application Performance Management (APM) solution that addresses all of the above and a lot more for applications developed in Python.
With today's release of AppDynamics 3.0, they're showing companies the value of a new approach - memory leak detection and root cause diagnostics in the production environment.
On the user monitoring front, iOS, Android, and JavaScript support is included with both tools.
AppDynamics and NewRelic each offer 4 approaches here: Application Performance Management High level metrics with drill downs to code level data about how your application is performing.
Bottom line: Beyond the shared database metrics that go a bit deeper with AppDynamics, it’s worth looking into the features available for your specific database within each tool.
Bottom line: AppDynamics provides deeper insights into garbage collection and memory leak detection beyond the standard metrics.
This ongoing trend has given rise to improvements in customer service, where interactions are delivered across multiple digital channels, ranging from social channels like Twitter and Facebook to text and voice communications.

Extending AppDynamics App iQ Platform: Microservices iQ extends AppDynamics' existing App iQ Platform that enables enterprises to deliver performance that exceeds the scale, sophistication, and velocity expectations of today’s customers.
The platform is the foundation to AppDynamics' customers' success and powered by intelligent Application Performance Engines.
These intelligent performance engines work in concert to help ensure enterprises can deliver peak performance across any application, user engagement, and business transaction.The new Microservices iQ capabilities enhance the core Appdynamics Platform that is already designed to provide end-to-end visibility into agile application infrastructure where microservices are deployed.
AppDynamics also leveraged the analysis results to help formulate the best ways to empower Agents of Transformation.
Use of the AppDynamics Real-Time Application and Business Intelligence platform is intended to ensure that applications always perform, and that decisions around technology and the software delivery lifecycle are always based on the right factual and contextual insights.
That in-memory platform delivered amazing computing power capable of simplifying the infrastructure of application environments while giving the business real-time insight.
The business impact derived with the right information at the right time is staggering to the point that customers have been willing to pay SAP handsomely for these capabilities.
Companies can drive huge revenue increases, save millions in cost, and reduce their risk substantially by better leveraging their data assets.
As these applications become increasingly critical to the business, it’s more important than ever to have a simple, yet fast way to monitor, diagnose, and resolve application problems before they affect revenue.
SummaryApplication owners need to be able to have the insight to gain real-time information of how their customers are using mobile and web applications while understanding how their applications drive revenue and create brand loyalty.
Out of the box, AppDynamics delivers key performance metrics in a helpful sharable dashboard, however, you can also create customized dashboards so various teams can see the metrics that matter most to them.SummaryIT Ops teams have more responsibility today than ever before.
Tools that help resolve issues quickly and gain visibility into a complex environment can become a key partner in overcoming this obstacle.
The goal is releasing better software more rapidly, and keeping said software up and running by joining development and operational responsibilities together.
This is extremely beneficial as many teams have different ways of collecting data, which can traditionally lead to inconsistencies.
They allow users to automatically discover and tag a business transaction’s performance with tagging.
The key to that is being proactive, and avoiding performance issues before going live in production.
They not only allow us to troubleshoot performance problems faster – they also allow us to perfect this code.
Because both of these values can be tuned, it can benefit you to tune them.Out-of-the-box, AppDynamics captures the entire stack trace while trimming any granularity below the configured threshold.
They’re expecting it to do great things for customer experience, productivity, costs and profitability, and speed of application delivery.
It focuses on the business transaction as the essential unit of measurement, and recognizes business stakeholders as essential members of the team.
Similarly, in order to measure the performance of an asynchronous transaction correctly, you will need to compute and track the end-to-end latency of an asynchronous transaction rather than the response time of initiating the client request.AppDynamics discovers asynchronous transactions, computes the end-to-end latency of the transaction and uses this metric to track business transaction performance.
To stay ahead of the competition, retailers need to move to an agile operating model.
This is essential because with the right management solutions it allows for a fast Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) of application performance issues and enables teams to work together when developing or enhancing application offerings.Securing 5 star rated mobile apps.
The number of apps in use is growing by day meaning highly responsive, convenient and usable apps are a must to secure 5 star app ratings.Correlating application and customer experience data.
Figure 2: AppDynamics Flowmap of  Hybris based retail commerce applicationAppDynamics delivers a comprehensive solution to help retailers maximize their business performance.
This means that ensuring flawless performance and optimizing customer experience is critical to retail success.
Another trend that makes the equation all the more complex is IT is delivering more and more modular applications at faster and faster rates making the entire application ecosystem very dynamic and highly error-prone.
Therefore you need an overview of your whole IT stack, which will be created using existing data from your available tools.
All the developers need to do is add the New Relic agent to the app they’re developing, and New Relic will automatically extract platform-specific metrics, whether in Java, Node, PHP, etc.
test automation tools and platforms definitely enable teams to resolve the issues faster and in a much more efficient manner by reducing the overall testing efforts.
These applications need to provide seamless customer experience in terms of fast performance and customer satisfaction with their interactions on almost all popular devices and platforms.
With well-designed and orchestrated Digital Assurance practices integrated with the DevOps cycle, organizations can fine-tune and supercharge application performance as well as customer experience quite quickly and can secure ‘Pole Position’ in the long run.
For this reason, Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools are essential for identifying performance problems and their environments.
Many companies are suffering from a case of too much monitoring, which can lead to less useful information.While it might seem counterintuitive, application performance monitoring is a space where less is more.
We believe in using automation to empower your people to solve bigger problems.We provide a suite  of proprietary apps in our internet performance management platform.
Expect a huge second mover advantage in the world of app development because you can be prepared to address the server traffic spikes, the user privacy issues, and the public safety controversies.The days of actual immersive virtual reality, complete with a 3D experience, might not be far off, but preparation is everything, especially with app developers, programmers, and IoT experts.
Ensure data stored in cache is in the format required to be presentation layer.
unless you work hard on optimizing it, simple logging will only take you this far.
so the release cycles are cutting down and log files are becoming larger, but that’s not all: the number of user requests grows exponentially and they all expect peak performance.
consider using an incident management system to handle information overload.
Look for ones that integrate well with your existing tool stack, as you’ll need the monitoring tool to be able to gather and interpret data directly from your existing sources.
By choosing service level indicators with the highest customer impact, SLOs can safely empower development to accelerate.
In this way, automation facilitates rapid dissemination of expertise across an organization, enabling teams to keep pace as demands on their time and skills increase.
This approach is infinitely better, no shelling out or wrapping tools, and you already have all your favorite frameworks, libraries,  test harnesses, and tooling at your fingertips.
Without carefully monitoring key metrics like uptime, network load, and resource usage, you’ll be blind to where to spend development efforts or refine operation practices.
This will allow you to develop your architecture around the monitoring tool, rather than having to retrofit existing code.
The goal is to drive the detection and diagnosis of application performance issues to ensure services perform at expected levels.
No matter what monitoring tools you ultimately use, you’ll want to make the most of the data they provide in the context of a larger reliability solution that drives actionability.
They have achieved this rapid release cadence while supporting the safe and reliable operation of their applications; in turn allowing them to respond more effectively to their customers’ needs.
In enterprise deployments, it is imperative to break the link between a user and the daemon, ensuring that only authorized users can complete authorized tasks against Docker.
In addition, knowing what is happening in your environment is paramount, knowing what containers are running vs what containers you expect to be running is key to ensure that you are not exposed to any “crypto-jacking” exploits where hackers gain access to an insecure Docker daemon and start bitcoin miners on your Docker Hosts.
There are many tools that help the migration to microservices, such as Spring Boot and Microprofile, both of which simplify the development of standalone apps in a microservices architecture.
Legacy apps should be migrated to independent, loosely coupled services through gradual decomposition, by splitting off capabilities using a strangler pattern.
In addition, retail customers are looking for a blended online and in-store experience and expecting brick-and-mortar stores and online channels to be integrated through an omni-channel strategy.
The automated system collects all the data needed and saves your team from doing it manually.
Its main goal is to make the cloud migration an easy and a smooth process.
Microservices architecture is becoming the most preferred architectural and development strategies.
The advantages of building and running software with this architecture outweigh the disadvantages.
Building highly efficient autonomous "small" teams to deliver new services or features faster, this means you do not have to wait for the long release cycle, you release features as soon as they are ready.
Increased productivity and speed of deliverables.
Isolated development approach results in highly independently deployable service, and testable service.
Managing and maintaining tests for the microservice is easier since the scope is limited to the service capabilities, automated testing for unit testing, regression testing as well as performance testing can be achieved easily.
The best suitable technologies can be leveraged to build specific microservices.
Teams can be spread across geography.
Microservices are easier to build and deploy; specifically on container platform, the resource utilization is optimized.
Cloud platforms provide many capabilities and tools to work with.
A fully managed system on cloud platforms is serverless.
Cloud-based serverless technologies are a big boost to companies smaller or larger to move their small functions/code like nano services, asynchronous jobs, scheduled jobs, integration of cloud services with on-premises.
It’s a pretty well-known and accepted fact that application performance monitoring is a must.
Many companies are suffering from a case of too much monitoring, which can lead to less useful information.While it might seem counterintuitive, application performance monitoring is a space where less is more.
The point of monitoring is to locate, identify, and prevent problems.
Increased complexity of systems means that simpler monitoring solutions are needed.
Nearly a quarter of apps are only opened once.Many enterprises are using AppDynamics to avoid such catastrophic situations and to minimize the negative impact on their brand reputation.
With AppDynamics, they are empowered to have real-time insights into application performance, user performance, and business performance so they can move faster in an increasingly sophisticated, software-driven world.
Expect a huge second mover advantage in the world of app development because you can be prepared to address the server traffic spikes, the user privacy issues, and the public safety controversies.
with that said, dedicated application performance management tools are no longer considered to be a luxury and rapidly become a standard.
when an error does come - you need to be able to solve it right away.
This provides a consistent and repeatable baseline measurement without all of the vagaries that can be introduced from real-user requests.A company should strive to understand why their site may be providing such widely different response times and seek to reduce the range of performance to a more consistent and narrow range.
These technologies enable new business opportunities, ways to optimize and automate, along with new ways to engage with users.These technologies have been enabled by a perfect storm of technologies converging.
These resources and platforms are easily accessible to all to collect data and provide insight into the usage of the thing.
This is why we believe seeing inside the software is key to visibility for purposes of troubleshooting and creating insight into the IoT.
As a company AppDynamics believes that IoT will be a key part of computing and interconnected systems of the future, our customers are increasingly applying our technologies to these use cases, and we look forward to becoming an integral part of both collecting and analyzing data within these systems.
From the broad variety of performance-testing tools, we found an open-source framework called Gatling to best suit our requirements (scalable, easy to learn, configurable scenario assertions, great detailed reports).
Apps that perform well will engage the customer — poor app performance is a sure fire way to lose the customer and their business.
Mobile networks (WiFi, 2G/3G/4G) that provide the data connectivity: The average mobile app can be used on 10-20 networks (from various service providers and in various geographies) and it’s critical to ensure performance across all these networks.
The teams also need an integrated approach for change and performance management that makes it more effective to collaborate and identify change-related issues faster.
With this comprehensive visibility, customers can proactively manage performance and quickly identify the root cause of issues, thus ensuring amazing mobile experience.
with so many alternative choices at their fingertips, the user has almost no tolerance towards ill-designed or poorly performing mobile applications.
your users understand this reality but are looking for well thought-out designs that have fewer performance and crash issues.
This is where the speed index measurement of the site comes in as it provides a relative measure of performance that can differentiate among websites with similar visually complete times to show which site will be perceived by the customer to have better performance.
Then engineering teams can go in and make the necessary code and infrastructure optimization necessary for software to actually perform better.
In many cases, the application performance monitoring (APM) and Business iQ platform served as the collaboration engine, with voice/video/chat software like Skype or Slack on top.
Monitoring systems need to grow ahead of the data and provide tools that scale.
An OverOps infused CI/CD pipeline offers increased developer velocity.
Companies began to realize that they could both improve operations and save money by migrating to the cloud.
Companies need an accurate way to analyze their payment history and usage growth rate to create expense projections.
Governance: Theoretically, if you can estimate that new resources are too expensive, you should be able to prevent their provisioning and deployment.
In addition to visibility, forecasting, and governance, it is crucial to shift cloud cost left and give developers the tools to prevent unnecessary cost increases as early as possible.
Companies like Snyk shifted security left and empowered developers by providing them with tools to detect and fix security problems much faster.
The same process needs to happen with cloud cost—developers need tools to understand how their code will affect cloud costs.
This is especially important since buggy applications are frustrating and considered unreliable by end users.
Performance monitoring is the last bit of monitoring that should be put in place after other areas are covered.
At Instana, we support OpenTracing as a key data source for our APM because we understand the great value it provides to developers that want to manually instrument their code.
We also see great value in agent-based automated tracing - especially for enterprises.
In these environments, it makes good business sense to understand performance with minimal effort, or automatically, with no adjustments to code needed to create the traces.
The user can choose the best tool for the job, and we will make sure that the end-to-end view is automatically created.
Nevertheless, there would be a high value if standardizing the TraceContext between APM vendors will work out as this allows for better interoperability between tools (especially important in Hybrid Cloud environments) - but we shouldn't mix this up with developer-oriented frameworks like OpenTracing.
The "Monitor" section of the DevOps loop provides the all-important feedback that drives future iterations.
Eventually, APM tools like AppDynamics, New Relic, and Dynatrace got really good at using automated methodologies to create code level observability (production profiling) in monolithic and SOA applications.
Tools, systems, and platforms making it easier and reducing the downside making it more consumable.
Several monitoring tools such as AppDynamics, Datadog, Grafana, and Prometheus are available to help collect this data and display it in efficient ways.
The ultimate goal is to help enterprises reduce the risk of end users impacting production deployments by monitoring and looping feedback earlier in the application lifecycle.
Developers should now be able to immediately see the potential impact of code changes, remediate and fix poor app behavior earlier in the lifecycle.
This is an ideal goal to work towards that will become increasingly important as the number of services, traffic, and data scales.
For organizations that are heavily siloed, this approach can help empower teams when it comes to operating their software.
It provides a layer of abstraction that allows you to get the data everywhere it needs to be without impacting developers and the core system.
By migrating to microservices IT will enable your teams to become more innovative as they are freed up from daily mundane tasks supporting and developing on a legacy system that simply cannot compete in the competitive world we are in today.
We create value on mobile apps with external development providing an entry point to enter the data center and consume our APIs.
We empower from hundreds to thousands of microservices to happen with a self-service platform for developers to publish new services and new versions as needed.
This makes it easier to respond to market shifts, be more responsive to customers, and occasionally shoot for the moon.
By splitting the legacy application into microservices, you have more freedom to innovate, for example, on the user-interface or reporting, while keeping the backend and processing platform unmodified.
It is important that API providers share their security practices like DataDog does, helping build trust, and demonstrate competency when it comes to operations.
Distributed tracing is opening the way to understand to what is really happening across microservices.
Kubernetes also has the best community support and exponential adaptability across the industry.
Kubernetes as an orchestrator is again dominating the microservices deployment world, as one of the most famous and liked platform to host and run microservices enabled with containers.
As distributed applications have grown in popularity, so have distributed tracing tools, providing a valuable overview to help you follow execution of the workload across a cluster.
You need to architect your application, nodes, and clusters to fit a tracing library, meaning it offers you unparalleled ability to find a problem, but only after you invest a significant amount of time.
Instead of maintaining state in your application, you instead maintain a continually updating log of events, and what triggered them in an external store.
Then if an application state is ever in doubt, and you need to debug what happened, you replay the events leading up to it to ascertain at what state the application should be.
More than a thousand companies use Stitch to move billions of records every day from SaaS applications and databases into data warehouses and data lakes, where it can be used for analysis, reporting, or training machine learning models.
Companies across the world are adopting cloud computing technology for multiple benefits.
It will increase the security level of your cloud-based apps.
This will help you create a strong solution, which delivers value to your end-users.
Companies like Spotify, Coinbase, Stitch Fix, and BuzzFeed use CircleCI to improve engineering-team productivity, release better products, and get to et faster.
PCF allows developers to deploy and deliver software quickly, without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.
Our platform is elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting their apps to et.
It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.
Azure Monitor maximizes the availability and performance of your applications and services by delivering a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry from your cloud and on-premises environments.
It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.
There's another important reason to study these metrics: they define the behavior of the infrastructure on which the applications run, and they can serve as an early warning sign of potential issues.
In a microservices landscape, we need to observe behavior across the multitude of microservices to get a better understanding of the application's performance.
The questions of where you are measuring the SLAs from is not simply resolved by using a third party; you need to make sure that your monitoring service is not monitoring from the wrong perspective.
But Microsoft hasn’t stopped there and is now attempting to address the needs of less technical users, involving them in the process by making serverless simpler and more approachable for non-coders.
If there are any errors in integrating changes, you can be notified and go straight in to fix the issue.
$BUDDY_FAILED_ACTION_LOGS will give an extensive overview of the logs of what went wrong, which is convenient because it helps in diagnosing any issues that pop up.
Rollbar helps developers deploy better software by helping you identify, prioritize, and help resolve code errors.
It works on the back-end and helps developers make sure that their APIs are working as intended.
It is regarded as one of the best tools for web developers for the purpose of API testing requirements.
Embold is a general-purpose static code analyzer that helps developers analyze and improve their code by surfacing issues across four dimensions, including design and duplication.
It is certainly one of the top developer apps because of its rich set of coding tools and features.
You can rest assured that whatever scale of API you end up having it will auto-scale to the size you need and serve your users without any issues.
The ecosystem is so evolved you won't have any issues setting up the necessary tools.
API-driven companies need to look at more than just engineering metrics like errors and latency to understand how their APIs are used (or why they are not being adopted as fast as planned).
In the last few years, APM tools have become very popular for companies who have software applications, and especially SaaS ones.
This is because they are affordable and can be adapted to almost any kind of business.
Instana helps companies manage and understand their cloud, container, and microservice applications.
Here is the question, have you considered running your legacy apps inside service mesh, like Istio ?.
As he says, you can deal with the most common use-cases with the out of the box Kubernetes solutions for discovery (kub dns), load-balancing (with Services) and edge services/gateway (Ingress).
As Christian also points out, if you need to dynamically discover services by actively querying rather than knowing what you are looking for then Spring Cloud Kubernetes can be better than going directly to Kubernetes Apis.
If you need to refresh your app from a config change and see it update quickly without going through a rolling update (which would be needed if you were mounting the configmap as a volume) then Spring cloud Kubernetes config client could be of value.
The ribbon integration could also be of value if you need client-side load-balancing.
Some people use zipkin to identify dead services, but probably metrics/stats would be the better route if you are trying to break down and report by thrift method.
Still, if you plan on scaling scala, the twitter stack with Finagle etc is insanely good.
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system developed by Twitter because our service-oriented-architecture is so goddamned big that it's often hard to understand WTF is happening in any given request.
It will save you a lot of time and give you enough configuration options.
If you are not familiar with configuring K8s cluster, I recommend to deploy ELK by Helm.
Because zipkin dependencies is separate spark job .
Zipkin is a distributrd tracing tool for discovering machine-to-machine interaction which is why spans often cover HTTP.
The latter action is typically performed via HTTP but Zipkin is agnostic to how a span is started and ended.
If you just want to understand the workflow or just know about the types of calls being made inside OpenStack then Osprofiler is the best and easiest way to get the trace.
If you're using the legacy zipkin stream app then it's automatically configured to point to proper destination.
Zipkin is not a business transaction tracking system and it should not be used that way because it is not built for this purpose.
Also it's a greate tool for debugging/investigating problems in your application.
Zipkin  is a solution for distributed tracing.
In other words, one of the Vert.x 4 goals was to minimize the upgrading effort.
While Kafka can be used in many ways, it can be used as a transport for unidirectional single producer single consumer messages.
Zipkin is foremost intended to provide observability into a complex distributed network of services (aka Microservice Architecture).
As for the tools that may suit your needs: VisualVM and Yourkit mentioned by @Jonathan are good for looking at average situation in your program -- if you need to carefully inspect low level paths in your program  InTrace  might be a better choice.
I would say you would want something like a profiler, such as  Visual VM ,  - free and included with the JDK, or  YourKit .
It's not suitable, Zipkin is about tracing in distributed systems.
Tanzu Application Service is VMware's enterprise solution that is, if you want to think about it this way, a self-hosted Pivotal Web Services (this is a gross understatement, but works for this situation).
It is also a profiler, you can use to see which methods caused a request to be slow.
Further more, it can (soon) do distributed tracing which helps you to analyze and debug latency problems in a microservice environment by correlating related requests.
Another use case is lightweight web analytics to identify which devices and operating systems your customers use to access your site.
Also, stagemonitor is much more than just metrics.
As iabughosh said, the main focus on jaeger is traceability, monitoring and performance, not for logging.
Dynatrace(DT) and Datadog(DD) are two amazing monitoring products that are very popular in the industry.
Signing up for Datadog was very quick and required just an email address.
Datadog APM (Application Performance Management) provides a comprehensive solution for collecting, searching, and analyzing traces across fully distributed architectures.
And the usage is simple as just adding a client library since it can automatically trace requests across many popular libraries and frameworks.
As a Quality Assurance expert, what I am interested in are those specific logs, or metrics, that reflects the quality of our product, and finding ways to monitor those metrics on a regular basis and seeing their trends over time.
Fairwinds Insights findings and recommendations integrate within Datadog, enabling DevOps teams to manage Kubernetes and application containers more productively.
We are big fans of Datadog at Fairwinds using it across many of our Kubernetes managed services to ensure observability and the ability to discover unknown unknowns.
This integration allows more Datadog customers to benefit from improved security, reduced costs and saved time.
Fairwinds Insights provides a unified, multi-cluster view into three categories of Kubernetes configuration issues and prioritizes remediation actions around security, efficiency, and reliability.
The Datadog Marketplace is available now to all Datadog customers within the Datadog app for a free two-week trial for any application before committing to a purchase.
We’ve always greatly admired the power of the Datadog platform to provide us with best-in-class production observability, as well as their ability to remain agile and innovative and to continually redefine the monitoring space.
We’re excited by the opportunity to extend Datadog’s industry-leading visibility into the software development and pre-production workflows.
We believe joining Datadog will accelerate our vision of helping thousands of engineering organizations operate with a better understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from git push to production.
Datadog is a monitoring service for monitoring servers, databases, tools, and services.
Analyze Every Trace, Every Call, Every ServiceIf you're involved in troubleshooting or optimizing application performance, your life just got much easier with Instana's newly released Analyze capabilities.
And the best part... you don't have to pay any extra fees to use our analytics capabilities, so you can benefit from them immediately if you are already an Instana customer.
Instana understands the health of each of these components as alerts you to any issues.
Instana’s automatic instrumentation will provide plenty of insight into the execution of both.
Instana will help you better understand your application, it’s interactions with both internal and external services and the implications of performance bottlenecks.
We believe that Instana has the best monitoring platform in the market for analyzing and troubleshooting the performance of cloud-native applications.
However, as expected, commercial tools like Wavefront, Datadog, Lightstep (which all have free trials) have extra value-added features.
Companies like Datadog, Skywalking, Jaeger, and LightStep are actively contributing to this standard, which is great news; it shows that the topic is pretty hot and we should probably think about it.
There are also commercial logging tools available, such as DataDog, New Relic and Lightstep that handle logging all levels of the application stack for you in one interface.
All modern monitoring platforms like Datadog, New Relic, and AppDynamic support monitoring of containers and microservices.
Over the years, I’ve looked many times at Datadog and asked myself if it could be helpful to us at Signiant.
Datadog really gives us that great visualization, alerting and a “single pane of glass” where we can see what’s going on with various components.
It’s incredibly helpful to be able to overlay events on time boards within Datadog when looking into what may be happening at a time period.
Datadog helps customers monitor the performance of their cloud applications and infrastructure.
It’s worth noting that Datadog is growing more quickly than most of its public market SaaS competitors particularly Elastic, Appdynamics (acquired by Cisco), Dynatrace, Splunk, New Relic and Solar Winds.
When thinking about performance, AppDynamics and New Relic are the main modern tools that come to mind.
Bottom line: We’re seeing that AppDynamics puts its priority on visualizing the stack from end to end, while NewRelic is focused on bottom line response times.
If you’ve already got AppDynamics deployed, consider using it as a significant source of truth about your applications.
If you’re stuck with an outdated CMDB, consider shifting your architecture and check out how AppDynamics can help with a free trial.
AppDynamics Pro enables a new level of automation because it knows exactly what is going on inside of your applications from both a business and IT perspective.
moreover, the appdynamics platform helps you to keep a check on the performance of the mobile app to ensure customer experience.
AppDynamics caters to larger enterprises looking for an all-in-one performance monitoring solution.
According to AppDynamics, its platform helps you to connect application performance and customer experience to your business outcomes with a smarter approach to performance management.
Best to have rules defined on a monitoring system like DynaTrace or Appdynamics that sends out proactive alerts.
But APM solutions like NewRelic, AppDynamics, and later DataDog made it easy for developers to catch problems early, write responsible code in terms of latency, and fix degradations very early in the process.
If you’re finding that your code is executing for too long, it may be time to collect diagnostic data with the AppDynamics for PHP agent.
AppDynamics can’t change the mindset of your organization, but it is a great way to foster collaboration across all of your organizational silos.
Recent research from AppDynamics found 96% of technologists recognize that having the ability to monitor all technical areas across their IT stack, including security, and directly link technical performance to business outcomes is important to them in 2021.
An overwhelming majority of technologists have seen and experienced the need for observability through the impacts of the last year, and this needs to become a priority all the way across the stack – from development to the end user and everything in between.
With each code push to the repository, or development branch, CI will automatically and continuously test your apps by running them through various code exercises to make sure this continuous code push doesn’t break anything in production.
DevOps teams must deal with logged exceptions, swallowed exceptions, and uncaught exceptions (defects) so they turn on the logs, error trackers, and APM tools.
The world delivers the unexpected into our applications, and we hope our logs, error trackers, and APM tools are good enough to help us fix what breaks.
But APM solutions like NewRelic, AppDynamics, and later DataDog made it easy for developers to catch problems early, write responsible code in terms of latency, and fix degradations very early in the process.
Companies like Snyk shifted security left and empowered developers by providing them with tools to detect and fix security problems much faster.
The same process needs to happen with cloud cost—developers need tools to understand how their code will affect cloud costs.
A simple “git push” can lead to a major cost degradation, but since developers don’t have the tools to take ownership of the process, they usually don’t take it into account.
Developers must have a way to see the impact of their deployments on cloud cost with a clear correlation.
AppDynamics Unified Analytics actually connects the dots between your application’s performance, end users and business outcomes in real time.
Auto-correlated rich, integrated data not only optimizes customer experiences, but drives a better business outcome as well.
Just like the Internet of Things itself, we set a baseline of healthy performance and learn from there, alerting you immediately to any performance deviations.ConclusionIoT applications cannot operate without a more comprehensive understanding of your customers and what they are striving to achieve.
The right analytics will deliver reliable performance data on the complex mix of software, hardware, networks and third parties that make up any IoT application.A flawless performance is the heart of your business.
Adding the right analytics module to your connected applications not only brings real-time analysis and visualization of automatically correlated data to get insights into cross-functional outcomes, but also enables IT and business users alike to quickly answer more meaningful questions than ever before, all in real-time.
performance issues, errors and exceptions happen all the time and we have to know what’s going on.
This data will prove invaluable in guiding future decisions in IT.”According to research from International Data Corporation, “the worldwide IoT market will grow from $655.8 billion in 2014 to $1.7 trillion in 2020 with a compound annual growth rate of 16.9%.
Look for ones that integrate well with your existing tool stack, as you’ll need the monitoring tool to be able to gather and interpret data directly from your existing sources.
Try to find tools that can generate visualizations and reports that your team will find useful.
Once monitoring is in place, there’s no better way to put that data to work than building SLOs and error budgets around them.
By choosing service level indicators with the highest customer impact, SLOs can safely empower development to accelerate.
Consolidating monitoring data into the service level indicators, combining several sources into a single measurement.
Empowering you to set thresholds for this metric over time, such as a total amount of downtime per month.
Development teams can use this error budget to safely move forward on projects that could impact SLOs, confident that they won’t step over the line.
Teams practicing DevOps often have automated alerting and sometimes responses, typically using the native capabilities of their monitoring platform, e.g., Datadog, Honeycomb, PagerDuty, AppDynamics, and Dynatrace, reducing the time they spend monitoring and fixing issues that arise.
Automation that is hidden away is just magic, so making the tasks performed by automations visible to the team is essential.
In this way, automation of operations in operational ways has come to define DevOps to date and the limitations of this approach are becoming manifest as teams migrate from a handful of on-prem deployable artifacts to dozens or even hundreds of microservices in the cloud.
How to Choose Monitoring Tools for DevOps and SREWhen developing for the reliability or implementing resilient DevOps practices, the heart of your decision-making is data.
Without a doubt, visibility is one of the most important things needed to help development, IT operations and DevOps teams ensure optimal application performance before an app goes into production.
Developers must work with IT operations to get maximum performance, but this joint effort requires a single version of truth—a shared view into how an application performs and what the impact is of each element of the application stack.
This visibility during development allows developers to see the performance impact of their changes in almost real-time, plus it helps eliminate finger-pointing when something goes wrong.
Features such as code level analysis and end-user experience monitoring should be utilized in test environments to ensure that performance gremlins are caught before they reach production and real customers.
Applications Manager is able to enable organizations to uncover end user, performance, and operational cost impacting issues in cloud environments and enterprise software much earlier in the delivery pipeline.
The entire APM market was built around the concept of creating observability.
The team of developers was able to identify just how fast or slow SQL queries actually are, find out about slow database calls, long running queries, and overall performance of the database.
This way, it gives developers an earlier advantage, in the pre-production environment itself, of drilling down to monitor the JVM's performance and availability, notifies them of health and performance issues of JVM, Java memory allocations, and garbage collection, and early detection of memory leaks.
This kind of visibility, when provided to developers, helps them to better deliver a seamless user experience.
AppDynamics offers a complete system for adding beacons and IoT devices as part of your application infrastructure and monitoring the performance to ensure you deliver a delightful and performant end-user experience that increases engagement, interactions, brand attachment, and conversions to drive your key business KPIs.
It is important that API providers share their security practices like DataDog does, helping build trust, and demonstrate competency when it comes to operations.
Datadog, a leading market player, revealed a series of new DevOps initiatives for expanding use cases for agent software that powers monitoring services of the company.
With this approach, DevOps teams will be able to rationalize the types of agent software needed for deployment for monitoring applications, infrastructure, cybersecurity, networking, and user experience.
With the growing dependency of organizations on digital business processes, organizations avail DevOps services for instrumenting complex IT processes and offer high benefits to their clients.
Implementing automation would be useful in reducing errors.
Raygun gives your development team a unique view of how users are experiencing your software applications.
Datadog wants you to view all your application performance metrics in one place - and does so well.
In conclusion, each of the performance monitoring tools above offers something slightly different, but are all built around the same goal - seeing what your users are doing when they encounter problems.
Usually, developers have to hunt around for clues as to why their software is not performing as expected.
Ultimately, performance problems are a huge contributor to dissatisfactory software experiences.
Therefore, it's down to the software engineering team to be proactive in making sure their applications are performing for users in the way they are intended.
Teams slow to adopt such visibility stand to lose out to their more innovative competitors that took more care of how users experience their application.
DataDog is one of the more well-known products on this list and has been around for about 10 years (at the time of this writing).
It was abundantly clear that the breadth of offerings in DataDog’s catalog could be integrated and finely tuned to drive not only triage, but automated mitigation with features like code deployment kill switches and API triggered workflows.
If you’re looking for a product that allows you to hit the ground running early in an application’s lifecycle, this is a solid, affordable option.
But as you move forward into production scenarios, you might need to partner with additional open-source analytics tools to track down details of your application’s behavior.
Users can easily customize the visual dashboard and reports with a number of options for graphs, metrics, and alerts.
Monitoring allows the IT pros to develop insights regarding potential issues, especially as an organization grows and puts more stress on the current systems.
Those insights will translate into recommendations and decision-making that is based on solid information.
Using proactive monitoring tools means that you will receive alerts before an issue becomes a disaster.
Small discrepancies and early warning signs will allow your IT folks to anticipate potential issues and ward them off.
This is a far more productive approach than facing the disasters after they occur and trying to put out fires.
Datadog Application Performance Monitoring (APM or tracing) provides you with deep insight into your application’s performance — from automatically generated dashboards for monitoring key metrics, like request volume and latency, to detailed traces of individual requests — side by side with your logs and infrastructure monitoring.
It helps you understand how your applications are performing and proactively identifies issues affecting them and the resources they depend on.
These capabilities help DevOps teams avoid downtime, resolve performance issues, and ensure customers are getting the best user experience.
Provides visibility on application performance for enterprises.
It allows users to create effective strategies to improve their services, apps, and tools.
AppDynamics efforts and dedication to the APM market space over the past ten years has led to a solution that includes: end-user monitoring, business performance monitoring, APM functionality (of course) and their App iQ platform - which provides business-centric analytics and dashboards.
According to Gartner, AppDynamics is the current leader in their 2018 Magic Quadrant for Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Suites.
This increased patchwork of different pieces, combined with the speed at which applications are being developed, means that it’s necessary to offer comprehensive performance coverage.
The new APM is capable of performing a full end-to-end transaction trace within production environments.
AppDynamics and New Relic are top of the line APM tools, each traditionally targeted a different type of developer, from enterprises to startups.
Its built-in intelligence has transformed our IT team from being reactive to proactive.
Now, we’ve transformed the ability of our IT team to optimize performance and deliver proactive support for MyWipro with the implementation of AppDynamics.
We’ve truly gained a sincere understanding of end-user experiences and an ability to rapidly resolve issues in real time—to ensure our employees and contractors can access the services they need.
As global IT continues to embrace foundational digital transformation concepts, corporations without a plan or strategy will find themselves chasing the industry and will be at a disadvantage to any competitors.
This percentage is expected to rise rapidly as corporations continue to evolve their digital transformation efforts.
I don’t want to discount the value of deep knowledge and experience in the APM space, but after watching a demo or two and playing with the software a bit I felt like I could use AppDynamics to find problems and performance bottlenecks in an application.
The second phase of learning was digging into customer use cases and how they realize value with AppDynamics.
FamilySearch:  Using AppDynamics FamilySearch saved $4.8M in infrastructure and related costs over two years by making their applications more efficient.
With help from AppDynamics they scaled the use of their application 10x without growing their infrastructure!
Fox News:  After deploying AppDynamics they reduced their MTTR (mean time to resolution) from weeks to under a few hours.
They decreased the number of support tickets by 90%, and they stabilized new releases in hours compared to the full week it used to take them.
Edmunds.com:  With AppDynamics they went from having 10 people working on a single problem for several days to fixing things in a few hours.
That’s a huge productivity improvement and a dramatic reduction in lost revenue.
During a proof-of-value implementation with a large prospect we helped them immediately identify a bug they knew existed but couldn’t find.
That’s an unbelievable cost savings and it took less than an hour!
It can help you drive revenue, reduce costs and mitigate risks.
Unified Analytics bridges the gap between application performance, users and business outcomes in real time.
Application owners and LOB managers are able to utilize auto-correlated and integrated data in order to better understand a customer’s experiences and lead the way to optimize business results.
With the next generation of Unified Analytics solution, application owners can quickly answer more meaningful questions than ever before, all in real-time, and gain insight into how, when and where end users use applications and engage with their business.
The unified analytics solution allows them to quickly query customer usage information to enhance persona knowledge and leverage the data to drive customer enablement and prioritize product development effortsWithin AppDynamics’ extensive analytics solution, application owners have access to customizable dashboards that rapidly analyze and visualize large data sets.
They can leverage pre-built widgets or build their own charts with the ability to analyze multiple fields in x- and y-axis and quickly build interactive custom analytics dashboards to get insights, monitor trends, and influence business outcomes.
Integrated reporting capabilities make it fast and easy to share insights with team members and senior management, and easily enforced privacy and access control through role-based access control features available with each module maintain security on a micro-level.
A key factor of visibility is being able to visualize your entire back-end environment, as transactions occur.
Application owners must be able to have that visibility at all times, in order to proactively optimize their application’s performance.
In their latest Critical Capabilities Report for APM, they’ve highlighted IT Ops as one of these vital use cases along with DevOps teams, application support, application development, and application owners.How to Support IT OpsAnomaly Detection, health rules, and alertingFinding and responding to instances that fall outside of the norm in terms of application performance is indispensable for IT Ops.
Additionally, DevOps aims to improve business outcomes, but there are challenges in selecting the right metrics and collecting the metric data.
One of the core tenants of DevOps is measurement, and using said measurements as facts when driving decision making.
The second challenge (which Gartner does not discuss), is how these metrics should be linked together to offer meaningful insights.
If the metrics do not allow linkage between a release and business performance, attribution gaps remain.
Ensuring Application Performance With Business TransactionsApplication developers are constantly working on the next release to drive a stellar experience to their end users.
Understand how each new release impacts the value provided to the user and your business by comparing Business Transaction performance.
Business Transactions are the aggregate of all the required software functions and components called upon to deliver an application response to a device or user initiated request.
That visualization prioritizes the end-to-end business transactions performance, not just the health of the application and infrastructure nodes.While you’re able to track performance issues through benchmarking in production environments, it’s also critical to be able to capture potential issues in pre-production usage as well.
The key to that is being proactive, and avoiding performance issues before going live in production.
Before we built our IoT Monitoring Platform to help operations teams manage IoT applications efficiently, it was important for us to understand monitoring requirements from both the technical and business end.
IoT devices generate tremendous amounts of data and it’s important to be able to get insights into the business performance quickly.
For example, when a business is losing money, it should be easy to quickly identify the root cause of a performance issue.
You need to analyze your application behavior and configure the alerting engine accordingly.
Clearly, there needs to be a visualization of the services path including traceability from end to end for each interaction, from the user through all of the services calls, along with the infrastructure.
We identify the source of errors within and across services much faster in test or production environments so that Developers can fix them right away.
When you are dealing with many interconnected services you must use monitoring that tracks all of your transactions by tagging them with a unique identifier and following them across any application components or services that are touched.
In this way you will be able to immediately see when, where, and why a request has slowed down.
To find and remediate these code issues quickly you must have a monitoring tool that automatically finds the problematic code and shows it to you in an intuitive manner.
Finding and fixing bottlenecks and errors in custom applications is why AppDynamics exists.
When a new application works effectively in your hybrid cloud infrastructure, you gain confidence in your investment and quickly bring additional workloads into the new model.
As they continue to overhaul their creaky legacy systems, airline DevOps should make application performance management a critical part of their new tech infrastructure.In today’s market, highly stable software for airlines is critical to functioning efficiently, building customer loyalty and increasing profits.
Breakdowns such as those described here are a direct hit to sales and company reputation.
Application performance management platforms like AppDynamics helps eliminate problems before they happen.
It’s critical to monitor everything from end-user transaction monitoring, infrastructure, network performance management, and capacity in the cloud, as well as rapidly identify problems like application delays.
In the end, you get a clearer, simpler view of your IT landscape, faster resolution of problems, and better business performance.
The automatic, dynamically set baselines are hugely useful in agreeing on SLA performance thresholds.
You can proactively define the events that are of greatest concern for keeping your applications running smoothly and then create policies that specify actions to start automatically when those events occur.An action is a predefined, reusable, automated response to an event.
AppDynamics Application Intelligence helps retailers, including those leveraging Hybris to power their applications, take their digital strategies from good to great by ensuring mobile and eCommerce performance, allowing business, dev and ops teams to collaborate easily and automatically correlating technical performance with business outcomes.
Another trend that makes the equation all the more complex is IT is delivering more and more modular applications at faster and faster rates making the entire application ecosystem very dynamic and highly error-prone.
These metrics are presented with a certain level of correlation that allows the user to analyze the data easily, and quickly detect the cause of the problems or potential optimizations in order to maintain an expected service level.
Enterprises and companies need to adapt to continually changing technical landscape and keep up with the change.
Systems are becoming more and more complex and are not easy to manage.
Microservices architecture is becoming the most preferred architectural and development strategies.
Increased productivity and speed of deliverables.
Isolated development approach results in highly independently deployable service, and testable service.
How cool would it be if you were able to automate most of the remediations, self-healing!
It’s a pretty well-known and accepted fact that application performance monitoring is a must.
Many companies are suffering from a case of too much monitoring, which can lead to less useful information.While it might seem counterintuitive, application performance monitoring is a space where less is more.
Increased complexity of systems means that simpler monitoring solutions are needed.
The problem becomes that companies make these types of decisions without any idea of how it affects their site performance.
The impact of that site performance then reflects on the conversion rate of their web page.In addition to the average response time, another interesting aspect of performance is the variation over time.
As a general rule, companies should certainly strive to provide customers with as consistent an experience as possible, and performance is a key part of providing a consistent experience.
A company should strive to understand why their site may be providing such widely different response times and seek to reduce the range of performance to a more consistent and narrow range.
To satisfy customer expectations, it needs to meet the demands of an agile, digital business, while also maintaining and operating essential core systems.
You must support hybrid architectures spanning many operating models, leading to interdependencies.
Observability is the central nervous system for the digital enterprise.
Within organizations, it’s what connects applications to business, security, and more.
With this data, you can make decisions that benefit customers and internal stakeholders.
Sales and marketing want new features to sell and promote.
The world delivers the unexpected into our applications, and we hope our logs, error trackers, and APM tools are good enough to help us fix what breaks.
OverOps makes your developers better with instant, deep insights on where, when, and why code breaks — and who wrote it.
An OverOps infused CI/CD pipeline offers increased developer velocity.
But traditional tagging is manual, error-prone, and extremely inefficient, so automating the tagging is crucial.
Companies need an accurate way to analyze their payment history and usage growth rate to create expense projections.
Shifting cloud cost management left by empowering developers and giving them the tools to proactively correlate deployments and cloud costs (rather than leaving it to the IT/Ops teams with the current reactive approach) can prevent cost degradations much earlier in the process and boost overall efficiency.
To help equip you for the ongoing process of optimization and the life of debugging ahead of you, we’ve gathered a list of the best tools to monitor the JVM in both development and production environments.
Without logging latency, availability, and other reliability metrics throughout your system, you’ll have no way of knowing where to invest your development efforts.
Try to find tools that can generate visualizations and reports that your team will find useful.
By choosing service level indicators with the highest customer impact, SLOs can safely empower development to accelerate.
Empowering you to set thresholds for this metric over time, such as a total amount of downtime per month.
SRE tools that help you construct thorough and meaningful incident retrospectives will give you an excellent foundation for review and growth.
While monitoring tends to focus more on the overall health of systems and business metrics, observability aims to provide more granular insights into the behavior of systems along with rich context useful for debugging and business purposes.
Likewise, it's important that data can be made available to the entire enterprise (or, in some cases, made available to the entire enterprise).
Finally, as vendors in this space converge on features (which they are), differentiating capabilities are released (which they will need), or licensing/pricing issues arise (which they do), it's likely that the business will need to add or remove SaaS solutions over time.
An observability pipeline, as we will later see, allows us to evaluate multiple solutions simultaneously or replace solutions transparently to applications and infrastructure.
With an observability pipeline, we decouple the data sources from the destinations and provide a buffer.
This makes the observability data easily consumable.
This also gives us greater flexibility in terms of adding or removing data sinks, and it provides a buffer between data producers and consumers.
Confident Cloud Migrations — Lifting and shifting SAP business applications is expensive, time-consuming and error-prone.
S/4HANA Adoption — The movement towards S/4HANA is of high strategic importance to most SAP users for performance and support requirements, but the transition can introduce technical and business challenges.
Microservice architectures are by nature more complicated, with many more services than traditional applications.
New AppDynamics Software Hunts Memory Leaks, Finds Root Cause, and it's All in Production Java memory issues are common and often difficult to diagnose.
Profilers and other tools are great, but they have their blind-spots.
For production environments, profilers can constitute a lot of overhead.
They rely on heap dumps instead of runtime data, and the heap dump approach is not suitable for large heap sizes that are commonly found today.
Some profilers have non-heap dump approaches, but they only capture shallow object sizes.
“Best case scenario, a memory leak causes your system to slow down, dragging application performance well below established SLAs.
Worst case scenario, your servers crash completely and you don’t know why.
A: Before using AppDynamics, it was hard to handle huge volumes of data and business transactions, in addition to complex applications, with other APM tools.
Manually instrumenting these large number of microservices and setting static threshold for altering can be a very difficult task if not impossible.
That’s an expensive and time consuming process that only offered the insight you’re looking for hours, days or even weeks later.
We were discussing database performance and I was surprised when he told me that the most common cause of database performance issues (from his experience) was a direct result of contention on shared storage arrays.
Databases that once played nicely together on the same spindles can become the worst of enemies and sink the performance of multiple applications at the same time.
Imagine being able to detect an end user problem, drill down through the code execution, identify the slow SQL query, and isolate the storage volume that is causing the poor performance.
If there’s a performance issue, the corresponding node will intuitively flag the problem and illustrate the affected nodes.Along with your application flowmap, we know it’s important to monitor and communicate your applications’ health to a wider internal audience.
They realized that while their developers were using TDD and agile methodologies, work spent far too long in queue, flowing from isolated workstations—product management, UX, developers, QA, various admins, etc.—until finally it was deployed into production.
First of all, you have dozens of applications running with several instances each on different nodes, which are very often assigned dynamically, and finding the place where something went wrong is a very tough task.
A failure in a monolithic application usually means total unavailability.
You won't find any concrete solutions here, but rather a high-level overview of how many different, and complex problems we need to solve before we go for microservices.
Secondly, even if you identify bounded contexts perfectly, but some of your services use the same database (schema) your applications will still be coupled, and you won't be able to deploy them independently, and in case of a database failure all of them will be unavailable.
There are two problems with this: first, the request will keep going to the down service, exhausting network resources and slowing performance.
Second, the user experience will be bad and unpredictable.
When the service portfolio increases due to microservice architecture, it becomes critical to keep a watch on the transactions so that patterns can be monitored and alerts sent when an issue happens.
Once we implement database-per-service, there is a requirement to query, which requires joint data from multiple services — it's not possible.
When something goes wrong, the older version can be rolled out, and you can iterate on the canary deployment branch and keep rolling that out until it meets expectations.
Not surprisingly, when asked, engineers list monitoring as one of the main obstacles for adopting Kubernetes.
Time series data is great for determining when there is a regression but it's nearly impossible to use it to determine which service was the cause of the problem.
As hardware failure became the common case rather than the exception, Google engineers needed to design accordingly.
Secret management is essential for cloud-native solutions but is often neglected at smaller scales.
while some errors may be trivial, others break critical application features and affect end-users without you knowing it.
The complexity and scale issues presented by IoT on both the backend (in the cloud) and the frontend (things themselves) is a major challenge for not only the systems themselves, but for the management tooling of these interconnected and fluid systems.
There’s a lack of expertise of what to look for and how to look for it.
Ignoring the underlying performance bottlenecks and tricking the user with a UI band-aid is akin to placing tape over a crack in your drywall — you’re only covering up the symptom of an underlying problem.
Development Efficiency and MeasurementSeeing and improving the efficiency of Software Development teams is a problem for every technical team manager.
Neither is sufficient to ensure their business counterpart, as humans are an important part of the mix, but without software agility or velocity, the business is doomed to being inflexible and slow.
Such modern development is iterative, but it’s still slow and hard to maintain for rapidly changing apps.AppDynamics has solved these problems.
When applications are emitting thousands, millions, perhaps even billions of data points, it can be impossible to sift through all the noise to find the signal.
We don’t have any storage available and the EMC storage we ordered is still stuck in customs…” The frustration drove us to look for more agile alternatives and eventually led us to migrate to the cloud.
However, it also makes cost forecasting much more challenging.
This was a painful experience for both engineering teams trying to piece together what caused a bug, and also for the user who experienced the bug and was responsible for reporting it.
Since then, engineering teams have standardized on error monitoring software that automatically captures and alerts on errors, but this still requires lots of engineering overhead to triage the list of errors continually.
The challenge with performance monitoring most teams face is knowing when is fast really “fast enough”.
Performance bottlenecks in your code base can produce downstream effects on multiple services, sometimes leading to a cascading failure.
In microservices architectures, understanding dynamic dependencies using topology and graph analysis is more difficult than in traditional architecture.
Modern application delivery has shifted to CI/CD, containerization, microservices, and polyglot environments creating a new problem for APM vendors and for observability in general.
New software is deployed so quickly, in so many small components, that the production profilers of the SOA generation have trouble keeping pace.
They have trouble identifying and connecting dependencies between microservices, especially at the individual request level.
Those production profilers employ various algorithms that limit the amount of data collected and therefore provide only partial data or meta-data for most of the requests flowing through the system.
This strategy MIGHT be acceptable for SOA applications, but is completely unacceptable in the microservices world.
Unfortunately, there is no gain without pain; in this case, the pain is the extra resources required from both developers and operators to collect and manage this extra data.
The problem is so pervasive that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has multiple open source observability projects in either the Incubation or Graduated phase.
Errors and failed requests – You need to make sure that the number of failed requests and other errors is not larger than is usual for your site, otherwise you’re testing error conditions instead of realistic traffic.
These problems, like a mobile carrier experiencing an outage, may be due to our errors or to external conditions; but they should nevertheless be discovered as early as possible.
Even the simplest query like finding the average session length will cripple time-based stores with out-of-memory errors as session length has to be derived from the first and last event for each user.
More sophisticated analytics like funnel and cohort retention analysis cannot be done unless you wait for a long-running job to load and transform the data over hours or days eliminating the advantages of self-serve interactive analytics.
Especially when you’ve got a bunch of developers all pushing to a single code base, it is difficult to realize when you’ve impacted the response times of another endpoint.
Similarly, it's much more difficult to correlate the behavior of a single service to the user's experience  since partial failure becomes more of an everyday thing.
Many companies are struggling to achieve the flawless canary deployment strategy due to lack of Automation skills.
These numbers are difficult to estimate without some real-world testing.
The most difficult form of observability is distributed tracing within and between application services.
With traditional monitoring tools, it's either extremely difficult or impossible to isolate and compare the performance of individual application features as required when introducing new client functionality.
Unfortunately, however, those short-cuts can lead to costly performance testing mistakes and oversights.
The most common real-world problem we hear from customers is how they can stay relevant to their end-users and customers.
Clients don’t want to just know there’s a problem, they want to know how to mitigate it and see what happened.
